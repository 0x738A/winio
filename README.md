The WinIo library allows 32-bit and 64-bit Windows applications to directly access I/O ports and physical memory.

## Copyright

This library was written by Yariv Kaplan, which could be download from www.internals.com.

## Why have this repository?

Because www.internals.com is down latest, I couldn't download it, so fork this useful library for backup purpose.

The tag 2.0 is the version that supported win9X.
